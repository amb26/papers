    abstract = {This paper is written by two people who come from rather different  backgrounds, yet who, at the same time, share similar concerns about the human-computer interaction (HCI) area. One of us has a background in computing and cognitive science.  The other person has a background in software engineering and computer systems design.  As both of us are concerned with making more useful and usable computer applications we  decided to look further for frameworks to help us. In this paper we shall try to expose  some of the problems that we encountered in our joint effort to understand the HCI area  and contribute to it, and to discuss some of the tensions and alternative viewpoints that  we met on the way. The paper does not contain a solution to the problems of HCI. Rather,  it contains a dialogue with ourselves about the matters of our concern, and we invite the  reader to join this dialogue: our focus is on technology in use, where we emphasize the  setting in which a piece of technology is used.},

    abstract="We introduce the grab `n' drop toolglass, an extension of the toolglass bi-manual interaction technique. It enables users to create and configure their own toolglasses from existing user interfaces that were not designed for toolglasses. Users compose their own toolglass interactions at runtime from an application's user interface elements, bringing interaction closer to the objects of interest in a workspace. Through a proof-of-concept implementation for Mac OS X, we show how grab `n' drop capabilities could be added to existing applications at the toolkit level, without modifying application source code or UI design. Finally, we evaluate the power and flexibility of this approach by applying it to a variety of applications. We further identify limitations and risks associated with this approach and propose changes to existing toolkits to foster such user-reconfigurable interaction.",

    abstract="The chapter deconstructs the notion of malleability in regard to interactive systems, mainly seen as the affordance that the system offers to the end users to adapt (some of) the system's behaviors and structures to their contingent needs, and it positions this concept in the ambit of the different approaches that have characterized it so far in the EUD perspective. The notion of malleability adopted in this chapter lies at the core of a research line that, starting in the late `90 with the notion of Coordination Mechanism, is now focusing on a conceptual framework called Logic of Bricolage. This framework conceives of malleability as a first-level affordance to be put in the hands, i.e., in full control of the end users to empower them in appropriating and adapting their applications at different (potentially any) level of detail. The chapter illustrates how this framework has been defined on the basis of several field studies and sketches how it can be instantiated in a computational platform, AdHoc, that is currently oriented to document-based management systems. The chapter will highlight the research efforts that are still needed to make the framework more effective in supporting the collaborative bricolage of the end users.",
