    abstract = {This paper is written by two people who come from rather different  backgrounds, yet who, at the same time, share similar concerns about the human-computer  interaction (HCI) area. One of us has a background in computing and cognitive science.  The other person has a background in software engineering and computer systems design.  As both of us are concerned with making more useful and usable computer applications we  decided to look further for frameworks to help us. In this paper we shall try to expose  some of the problems that we encountered in our joint effort to understand the HCI area  and contribute to it, and to discuss some of the tensions and alternative viewpoints that  we met on the way. The paper does not contain a solution to the problems of HCI. Rather,  it contains a dialogue with ourselves about the matters of our concern, and we invite the  reader to join this dialogue: our focus is on technology in use, where we emphasize the  setting in which a piece of technology is used.},
